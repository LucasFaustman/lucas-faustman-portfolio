## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The focus for my portfolio was to make a clean, simple design for users to see my past work and get in touch with me. The biggest challenge was creating the contact me form and making sure the design of the website worked well across any devices.

## Optimizations

I'm happy with my portfolio as of now. I decided not to embed complicated links to my socials and projects so that the website loads quickly!

## Lessons Learned:

Colors on a webpage matter! I linked my portfolio on Twitter and a user gave me a critique that all my buttons were the same color. I quickly agreed and changed them so the contact buttons are the most eye-catching, which will bring more eyes to it, and hopefully more conversions! I learned the power of color in this project when styling.
